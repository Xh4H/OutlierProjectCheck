# OutlierProjectCheck
This is a simple [Tampermonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) script that will display the amount of tasks available on a project page, and if you are on EQ, the reason behind it. This relies heavily on Outlier API, sometimes the EQ reason will not appear because they directly do not give that information from time to time.

The script will create a draggable box on any page like `https://app.outlier.ai/projects/<project_id>`:
